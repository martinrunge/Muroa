/**
ringbuffer implementation that takes RTP packets as input and audio frames as output. Therefore, the RTP header has an additional flag inidcation the start of frame packet and how many packet belong to that frame, so it can tell if the frame is complete. Furthermore, it indicates the beginning of a new stream, that is when audio parameters or the decoder may change and must be reinitialized.
