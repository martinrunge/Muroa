Welcome to muroa's documentation!
=================================

Muroa is a multi room audio player. Multi room means that you can listen to the same music in multiple rooms at once while music playback is kept in sync. Very useful for parties.

* Client-Server design
* Server handles your local music colletion, it is called "session server"
* Playback clients (called render clients). Send your music to as many of them as you like
* Control clients are used to manage the playlist and add or remove render clients to a music session
* synchronous playback on all render clients. Place on in every room of your home and you can send your favorite music there.
